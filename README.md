# Quantum-Computing-Project
Only the following files are needed to view the project, the rest are just various prototypes and old versions:
The first file is GroverFinalClass.py it stores all the classes we use and the simulation can be ran from that file alone
The second file is LazyDenseGateInit.py which stores the code that was used to attempt to use lazy methods with our simulation
